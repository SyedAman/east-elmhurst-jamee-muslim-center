## What is This Project About?

### Introduction

A recent study indicated that there are around 1.8 billion Muslims living in the entire world. People can get lost with all the activities that might be going on or not even know all the opportunities available to them. Discovery is important. Events and news are spread out in so many platforms that users can feel lost and out of touch.

### Problem

Muslims today need a platform where they can stay in touch with each other and connect through events. They should be exposed to all the nearby activities that are happening so that they can interact more with other fellow Muslims.

Islamic organizations have difficulty growing their community, marketing, acquiring donations, and spreading news about themselves online. They also have the repetitive and often futile task of trying to make a website to engage with and inform the community.

### Solution

An application that centralizes information (events, news, donations, etc.) into one platform so that users can access essential information easily.

An application that streamlines the ability for an organization to create a profile webpage for their organization with good UX, acquire & connect with community members to grow its community, get funding, create content, spread news, and host events.
