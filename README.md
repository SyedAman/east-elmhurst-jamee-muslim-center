> Front End for the East Elmhurst Jam-E Muslim Center

## What is this?

This is a community made application for a non-profit Islamic organization for the purpose of creating an atmosphere where members of the community and neighborhood of the masjid (mosque) can engage and support each other.

This is an effort to revolutionize and become a model for other masjid websites to improve how Muslim communities communicate.

May The Most High accept from us.
